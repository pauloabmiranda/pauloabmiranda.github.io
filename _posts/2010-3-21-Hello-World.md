I have spend much time reading articles of others and they have helped me to evolve, to be better and i have come to a point when i felt that it is my time to share some of my experiences because being in the flash world is all about sharing knowledge. Flash would never come this far if it was not for this feeling in community.
Now it is my time and i hope i can help others to evolve and make them feel inspired.
